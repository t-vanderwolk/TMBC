## The Stroller Aisle Is… A Lot. Let’s Make It Less So.

If you’ve ever wandered into a baby store and thought, “Why does this feel like shopping for a car?”—you’re not alone.

    content: `# Car Seat Safety 101 — CPST Tips Every Parent Should Know

## Let’s Make Your Car the Safest Place on Earth

Car seat safety is overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. As CPST mentors we see the same questions every day, so here’s the calm, confidence-building crash course.

## 1. Rear-Facing Saves Lives

Stay rear-facing as long as the seat allows (often age 3–4). In a crash, the shell absorbs force instead of a child’s neck.

## 2. Tight Installation = Safe Installation

Your seat should move less than one inch at the belt path. If it wiggles, reinstall. Watch manufacturer videos and keep the manual handy.

## 3. Harness Must Pass the Pinch Test

If you can pinch the webbing at the shoulder, it’s too loose. Pull the tail strap until the harness hugs the chest snugly.

## 4. No Puffy Coats in Car Seats

Compressible layers create slack during impact.

**Instead:**
- Warm the car first
- Use a car-seat-safe coat or poncho
- Place a blanket over the harness

## 5. Don’t Rush the Next Stage

- Rear-facing → stay as long as possible
- Forward-facing → minimum age 5
- Booster → until the seatbelt fits (usually 9–12)
- Seatbelt only when knees bend naturally at the edge of the seat

## 6. Travel Like a Pro

- **Nuna PIPA RX + RELX base** for seamless daily installs
- **Nuna PIPA Lite** for belt-path travel
- **WAYB Pico** for toddler jet-setters

Practice in a rental-style vehicle before the actual trip.

## 7. When in Doubt, Book a CPST Check

Virtual or in-person, our Taylor-Made mentors double-check harness height, tether routing, recline indicators, and chest clip placement.

## The calm-core nursery
- 2 fitted sheets
- 1 waterproof mattress protector
- 1 cozy throw for late-night feeding

## Feeding station
Keep a rolling cart stocked with burp cloths, water, snacks, and a dimmable light. Rotate items every Sunday to keep it fresh.

## Postpartum command center
Create a small tray with postpartum care items (peri bottles, herbal sprays, comfy robes) and tuck notes with affirmations for middle-of-the-night lifts.`,

## Phase 1 — Ritual mapping
List your daily routines—morning slow start, lunchtime errands, evening bath. Build registry categories that support those rituals.

## Phase 2 — Concierge review
Book a mentor call before publishing your registry publicly. We’ll trim duplicates, add experience gifts, and build group gifting options.`,

## In: Sculptural lighting
Think plaster sconces, dim-to-warm pendants, and rechargeable lamps for late-night feeds.

## Out: Theme overload
We love a subtle motif, but 2025 is about layered textures, heirloom art, and personal artifacts.

## Wellness tech
Smart humidifiers and air quality monitors integrate with concierge dashboards for a balanced environment.`,

## Buying before mapping space
Always measure your hallways, doorways, and trunk depth before ordering large gear.

## Ignoring lifestyle
If you live in a walk-up, prioritize lightweight items and multi-use pieces.

## Forgetting support
Schedule onboarding sessions for pumps, carriers, or monitors so you’re not troubleshooting at 3am.`,

A bigger basket and all-wheel suspension will make grocery runs easy.

## Jet-set families
Prioritize quick folds, padded travel bags, and airline-friendly weight limits.`,
