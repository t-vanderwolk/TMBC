From the rhythm of nighttime feeds to morning stretches, this room is a microcosm of calm, connection, and care.\\n\\nWe begin with your sensory goals: Do you want the nursery to feel bright and energizing, or cocoon-like and tranquil? Research in environmental psychology shows that visual simplicity and soft light help reduce overstimulation for infants while supporting parent restfulness. Even your choice of color temperature (warm 2700K light over cool daylight bulbs) can shift the tone of late-night caregiving.\\n\\nFinally, we connect aesthetics to function.

Selecting these items through the lens of ergonomics and comfort prevents physical strain and emotional burnout. The more intuitive the flow, the more mental energy you preserve for connection.\\n\\nParent ergonomics are a design priority—your back, wrists, and posture matter as much as aesthetics. Opt for a changing setup where everything is within arm's reach. The average parent performs nearly 3,000 diaper changes in the first year; shaving seconds and steps from that routine adds up to real relief.\\n\\nFinally, think beyond the newborn stage.

This module helps you develop a confident internal compass. We'll explore how intuition builds through small daily choices: how you soothe, how you feed, how you show up.\\n\\nYou'll learn to separate data from doubt—understanding what evidence-based parenting looks like without feeling pressured to follow every new trend. We reframe mistakes as discoveries, and comparison as the thief of joy.\\n\\nConfidence doesn't appear overnight; it accumulates through consistency and connection. You'll end this module realizing that no influencer or book knows your baby better than you.\",\n            \"journalPrompt\": \"What kind of parent do you want to be remembered as—and what small habits could reflect that from the start?\",\n            \"apply\": [\n                \"Write an affirmation letter to future-you as a parent.\",\n                \"Share your parenting values with your mentor.\",\n                \"Add a keepsake notebook to registry for reflections.\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"module-postpartum-sleep-coordination\",\n        \"journey\": \"postpartum\",\n        \"title\": \"Sleep & Partner Coordination Strategies\",\n        \"subtitle\": \"Navigate rest, rhythm, and teamwork through fatigue\",\n        \"slug\": \"postpartum-sleep-coordination\",\n        \"registryFocus\": \"Family Coordination\",\n        \"estimatedMinutes\": 27,\n        \"accentColor\": \"#C8A1B4\",\n        \"heroImage\": \"/images/academy/postpartum-sleep.jpg\",\n        \"content\": {\n            \"explore\": \"Sleep deprivation doesn't have to equal survival mode.\",\n            \"lecture\": \"This module reframes sleep from something you lose to something you manage as a team.

Partners learn to shift from 'equal' to 'equitable' contribution: one handles dishes while the other naps, both win.\\n\\nWe wrap with science-backed rest hacks and humor (yes, the car-seat nap counts).

Whether you write to your newborn, your future toddler, or your past self, the process reminds you that growth is happening on both sides of the crib.\\n\\nLegacy isn't about perfection—it's about presence.
