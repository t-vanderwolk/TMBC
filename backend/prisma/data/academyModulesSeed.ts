From the rhythm of nighttime feeds to morning stretches, this room is a microcosm of calm, connection, and care.",

Research in environmental psychology shows that visual simplicity and soft light help reduce overstimulation for infants while supporting parent restfulness. Even your choice of color temperature (warm 2700K light over cool daylight bulbs) can shift the tone of late-night caregiving.",
